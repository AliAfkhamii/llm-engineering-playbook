# 🧠 A hands-on lab & playbook for mastering LLM systems

Welcome to my public learning journey through  **AI Engineering**. This repository contains my **personal notes**, **code notebooks**, **section breakdowns**, and **reflections** as I build a deep, practical understanding of modern AI Engineering, with a focus on **LLMs**, **RAG pipelines**, **vector databases**, **LangChain**, **tools like Docker & MLFlow**, and real-world deployment practices.
the base structure is followed by ZTM course

## 📚 What This Repo Contains

Each section of the repo has:

- 📝 **Summary Notes**: Core ideas, mental models, questions I asked, and key takeaways
- 📓 **Jupyter Notebooks**: Hands-on implementations and annotated code
- 💡 **Experiments**: My own variations on the material (e.g. custom retrievers, prompt tuning, API tool chaining)
- 🔁 **Reflections**: What I learned, struggled with, or changed in my thinking
